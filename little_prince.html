            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
            <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u>

            <!-- Final underlined sentence -->
            And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
            <u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</u>
